    This was a fun basic introduction to Javascript. The creator wrote the tutorial as if the reader was a cat; it also contains many cat pictures to go along with it. It goes through the main parts of JavaScript in an easy to understand format. It was also easy to follow the instructions since the creator added GIFs and pictures to guide the reader. This webpage could be done in a day perhaps even within a few hours. At the end of the tutorial the creator added extra resources so that readers can continue their JavaScript journey.
